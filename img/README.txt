README: Herd Prototype

The prototype for Herd was created using proto.io

Accessing our prototype:
To operate our prototype, you can either access it through the embeded prototype on our website <http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/crowd_power/team_hype/>
or through the dedicated public facing viewing page from proto.io at
<https://cristianlara.proto.io/share/?id=8de3d836-95dd-435b-871b-4454628aad86&v=1>. 

Instructions:
Our prototype allows users to test our three tasks.
Users can view what events are going on and easily tell the size of events by the size of the bubbles representing them. Events can also be sorted linearly by their relative sizes by clicking the sort button at the top left of the homescreen. Users can find events happening in the future by clicking the 'one week>' button.
To share events, users can click on the 'plus' sign on the home screens to create events. Users can click on bubbles to leave their own input. This takes the form of commenting on event pages and sliding a bar to express relative excitement for an event. When an event is going on, a plus button shows up inside of it in the photo stream that allows users to upload photos to the event page.
To more easily decide on an event to go to, users can see the excitement that others have for an event displayed in the form of fire. Each event page has a number of fires associated with a rating that shows how hyped other people are for the event.

Limitation of our prototype:
Naturally our prototype doesn't have actual events created by users so we created a few clickable event bubbles to show the information they are supposed to provide, but the homescreens mostly contain filler events.
Some of the icons are not as descriptive as we would like. This is because there was a limited selection of icons to choose from.
